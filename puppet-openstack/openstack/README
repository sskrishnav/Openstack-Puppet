###HA(high_availability) Node
For your HA node, you need to assign your node the high_availablity role. For example:

```
node 'ha.localdomain' {
  include ::openstack::role::high_availablity
}
```

###Controller Node
For your controller node, you need to assign your node the controller role. For example:

```
node 'control.localdomain' {
  include ::openstack::role::controller
}
```

It's important to apply this configuration to the controller node before any of the other
nodes are applied. The other nodes depend upon the service and database setup in the controller
node.

###Other Nodes

For the remainder nodes, there are roles to assign for each. For example:
```
node 'storage.localdomain' {
  include ::openstack::role::storage
}

node 'network.localdomain' {
  include ::openstack::role::network
}

node /compute[0-9]+.localdomain/ {
  include ::openstack::role::compute
}
```
